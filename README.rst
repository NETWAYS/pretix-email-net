This is a plugin for Pretix, which creates a custom template for emails.
In the template you can optionally display an event logo in the upper left corner and the signature is selectable.
The first two lines of the signature are in blue color.

To the right of the signature are four social media icons for Twitter, Youtube, Facebook and Instagram.

Installation:
Install the plugin with ``pip install pretix-nes-email``.
Then reconfigure Pretix with the commands ``python -m pretix rebuild && python migrate``
